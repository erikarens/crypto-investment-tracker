# Crypto Investment Tracker

## Overview
The Crypto Investment Tracker is a command-line Python application that allows users to track their cryptocurrency investments. It supports adding new investments, viewing existing investments, deleting specific investments, and calculating total investments.

**This is a small tool that helps you keep track of what you have bought and when. In this way, you can easily and simply keep track of when you can sell your cryptos at the end of the year in Germany to save tax.**

## Features
- **Add Investments**: Record the name of the cryptocurrency, the price at which it was bought, and the amount bought, along with an autogenerated timestamp.
- **View Investments**: Display all recorded investments or filter investments by a specific cryptocurrency.
- **Delete Investments**: Remove an investment record by its unique ID.
- **Calculate Totals**: Compute the total amount and total money invested, either for a specific cryptocurrency or for all investments combined.

## Usage

### Adding an Investment

```
python3 ct.py view
python3 ct.py view --coin Bitcoin

```

Example:
```
python3 ct.py delete 20240315123045

### Calculating Totals
To calculate the total investment, use the `total` command. To calculate the total for a specific cryptocurrency, use the `--coin` option.

python3 ct.py total
python3 ct.py total --coin Bitcoin
